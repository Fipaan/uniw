            <h3>Fun cat facts!</h3>
            <div class="accordion">
                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <div class="accordion-header">Only 20% of Orange Cats Are Female</div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        Female cats have two X chromosomes (XX), while a male cat has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (XY).
                        Color in cats is mostly related to their sex because the gene causing color is on the X chromosome.<br><br>

                        Because a male cat has only one X gene, if that X chromosome has the orange gene, he will be orange.
                        This means that if an orange female cat has a litter of kittens, all the males will be orange-regardless of
                        their dad’s color. But a female cat will only be orange if both of those X chromosomes carry the orange color,
                        meaning both parents must be orange to create an orange female kitten.<br><br>

                        We don’t actually know what percentage of cats are orange, but there are estimates that it’s somewhere between
                        2–5% of all cats. So if your kitty is an orange female, she belongs to an elite club!

                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <div class="accordion-header">Cat Whiskers Are as Sensitive as Human Fingertips</div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        Cat whiskers are thicker and coarser than regular fur and have roots that are three times deeper. They are
                        strategically located on the cat’s face to provide sensory equipment to help guide a cat through the day,
                        aiding vision and helping the cat to navigate, much like antennae on insects.<br><br>

                        Although the number of whiskers will vary by breed, most cats have 12 whiskers arranged in four rows on
                        each cheek. These whiskers are very sensitive, and this part of the face also contains small glands that
                        smell like your cat. This is one reason many cats love to have their faces rubbed!

                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <div class="accordion-header">Cats Use Dewclaws To Help Them Grip</div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        The dewclaw is the tiny little claw found up on the inner wrist of your cat - the one that is hard
                        to clip and that overgrows very quickly.  Technically, the dewclaw is very similar to the human thumb,
                        although it isn’t opposable. But cats can use it very effectively to grip onto a tree when climbing or
                        to hold onto prey when hunting.<br><br>

                        Dewclaws on cats rarely cause problems, but they will sometimes overgrow if they’re not trimmed regularly.
                        In most cases, it isn’t necessary to surgically remove a cat’s dewclaws. And, like all other cat claws,
                        it serves a function that your cat would miss if it wasn’t there.
